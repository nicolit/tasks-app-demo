# Basic kanban board 

Basic demo of kanban board using react, firebase and hooks.

Demo: https://kanban-board-875ad.web.app/ <br>
server repo: https://github.com/nicolit/tasks-app-server

Kanbab Board demo requires **React 16.8.0 or later** and **Firebase v8.0.0 or later**.
This project assumes that you’re using the [npm](https://npmjs.com) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) package managers with a module bundler like [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
Below is described information on how to perform basic tasks.
<br>

[Available Scripts](#available-scripts)
  - [npm start](#npm-start)
  - [npm test](#npm-test)
  - [npm run build](#npm-run-build)
  - [npm run eject](#npm-run-eject)


## Available Scripts

Within the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes so it's ready for deployment.<br>

### `npm run eject`


If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
